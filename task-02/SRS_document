1. Project Overview :

MeloFi is a web and mobile-friendly music streaming platform that lets users explore, play, and manage music.
Users can log in, discover tracks, view song details, create playlists, like songs, and search for specific tracks — similar in concept to Spotify or SoundCloud, but built in a simpler and achievable way.

The goal of this project is to build a platform using beginner-accessible technologies while learning web development concepts like backend logic, frontend design, and user flow.
It will also include low-fidelity wireframes to visualize layout and navigation before building the actual interface.

2. Project Goals :

To design and build a working music web app (and responsive mobile version).

To help users explore, play, and manage songs efficiently.

To learn Flask/Django, database handling, and frontend design.

To plan a clear user flow and structure through wireframes before development.

To integrate core features like login, playlists, and search.

3. Target Users :

Music Listeners: Users who want to discover and play songs.

General Users: Anyone who wants a personal and social music experience.

Developers / Students: As a portfolio and learning project.

4. Core Features :
User Features -

# Login / Signup :

Register or sign in securely using username and password.

Maintain session for logged-in users.

# Home Screen / Dashboard :

Displays recommended songs and recently played tracks.

Navigation bar with icons for Home, Search, Playlists, and Profile.

Simple layout with album art and track info.

# Now Playing Screen :

Shows current song details, album art, and playback controls (play/pause, next, previous).

Progress bar and volume control.

# Playlist / Liked Songs :

Users can view, create, and manage playlists.

Option to like or remove songs.

# Search Functionality :

Search by song title, artist, or album.

Search results displayed neatly with song info.

# Responsive Design :

Works smoothly on both web browsers and mobile screens.

5. Wireframes :
 
Before actual development, wireframes will be created using Figma or Moqups to visualize the layout and user journey.

6. Basic Tech Stack:

Since this project will be developed by a beginner who is eager to learn and explore new tools, the chosen technologies are simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to integrate while still offering room for growth.

# Frontend (Web & Mobile) :

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – For building the structure, styling, and interactivity of the web interface.

Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS – For faster and responsive UI design.

React.js – to create a dynamic web interface.

Figma / Moqups – For designing wireframes and visual layouts before coding.

music and cover will be fetched from an API

optional Features :

Dark/Light mode toggle
Audio controls (shuffle playlist, repeat track)
Progress Bar: Enable users to jump to a specific point in a song.
Offline Mode: Cache songs locally for playback without internet.

# Backend :

Python (Flask) – A lightweight web framework that is easy to learn.

REST APIs - manage data interaction.

SQLite – Simple database for storing user data, playlists, and song information (can later be upgraded to MySQL)

# Mobile frontend for Melofi  : using kotlin

music and cover will be fetched fom an API.
Exoplayer : for managing music playback efficiently.

Optional Features :
Follow MVVM (Mode-View-ViewModel) for clean and maintainable code.
 Dark/Light mode toggle
Audio controls (shuffle playlist, repeat track)
Progress Bar: Enable users to jump to a specific point in a song.

# Music Playback and Storage :

HTML5 Audio Player – For playing songs on the web directly through the browser.

Local File Storage – For storing and managing audio files, album art, and images.

# Authentication :

Flask-Login – To handle user login, signup, and session management securely.

# Version Control & Collaboration :

Git & GitHub – For version control, project backup, and collaboration.

# API :
music and cover will be fetched from an API 
 
7. Conclusion :

MeloFi is a full-stack learning project that combines music streaming, user interaction, and responsive design.
The inclusion of wireframes will help in clearly visualizing the app’s structure before coding, ensuring a smoother development process.
Through this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience in real-world web app development while building something enjoyable and useful.
